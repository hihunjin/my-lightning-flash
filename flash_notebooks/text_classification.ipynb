    "# Finetuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Finetuning consists of four steps:\n",
    " \n",
    " - 1. Train a source neural network model on a source dataset. For text classication, it is traditionally  a transformer model such as BERT [Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) trained on wikipedia.\n",
    "As those model are costly to train, [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) or [FairSeq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq) libraries provides popular pre-trained model architectures for NLP. In this notebook, we will be using [tiny-bert](https://huggingface.co/prajjwal1/bert-tiny).\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    " - 2. Create a new neural network the target model. Its architecture replicates all model designs and their parameters on the source model, expect the latest layer which is removed. This model without its latest layers is traditionally called a backbone\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "- 3. Add new layers after the backbone where the latest output size is the number of target dataset categories. Those new layers, traditionally called head, will be randomly initialized while backbone will conserve its pre-trained weights from ImageNet.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "- 4. Train the target model on a target dataset, such as Hymenoptera Dataset with ants and bees. However, freezing some layers at training start such as the backbone tends to be more stable. In Flash, it can easily be done with `trainer.finetune(..., strategy=\"freeze\")`. It is also common to `freeze/unfreeze` the backbone. In `Flash`, it can be done with `trainer.finetune(..., strategy=\"freeze_unfreeze\")`. If a one wants more control on the unfreeze flow, Flash supports `trainer.finetune(..., strategy=MyFinetuningStrategy())` where `MyFinetuningStrategy` is subclassing `pytorch_lightning.callbacks.BaseFinetuning`.\n",
