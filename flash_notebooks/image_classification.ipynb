    "# Finetuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Finetuning consists of four steps:\n",
    " \n",
    " - 1. Train a source neural network model on a source dataset. For computer vision, it is traditionally  the [ImageNet dataset](http://www.image-net.org/search?q=cat). As training is costly, library such as [Torchvion](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html) library supports popular pre-trainer model architectures . In this notebook, we will be using their [resnet-18](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_resnet/).\n",
    " \n",
    " - 2. Create a new neural network  called the target model. Its architecture replicates the source model and parameters, expect the latest layer which is removed. This model without its latest layer is traditionally called a backbone\n",
    " \n",
    " - 3. Add new layers after the backbone where the latest output size is the number of target dataset categories. Those new layers, traditionally called head will be randomly initialized while backbone will conserve its pre-trained weights from ImageNet.\n",
    " \n",
    " - 4. Train the target model on a target dataset, such as Hymenoptera Dataset with ants and bees. However, freezing some layers at training start such as the backbone tends to be more stable. In Flash, it can easily be done with `trainer.finetune(..., strategy=\"freeze\")`. It is also common to `freeze/unfreeze` the backbone. In `Flash`, it can be done with `trainer.finetune(..., strategy=\"freeze_unfreeze\")`. If one wants more control on the unfreeze flow, Flash supports `trainer.finetune(..., strategy=MyFinetuningStrategy())` where `MyFinetuningStrategy` is subclassing `pytorch_lightning.callbacks.BaseFinetuning`.\n",
