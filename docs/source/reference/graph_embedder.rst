********
The Task
********
This task consists of creating an embedding of a graph. That is, a vector of features which can be used for a downstream task.
The :class:`~flash.graph.classification.model.GraphEmbedder` and :class:`~flash.graph.classification.data.GraphClassificationData` classes internally rely on `pytorch-geometric <https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric>`_.

*******
Example
*******

Let's look at generating embeddings of graphs from the KKI data set from `TU Dortmund University <https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets>`_.

We start by creating the `TUDataset <https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/torch_geometric/datasets/tu_dataset.html#TUDataset>`.
Next, we load a trained :class:`~flash.graph.classification.model.GraphEmbedder` (from a previously trained :class:`~flash.graph.classification.model.GraphClassifier`).
Finally, we save the model.
Here's the full example:
